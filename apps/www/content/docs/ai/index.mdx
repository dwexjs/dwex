description: Build faster with AI assistants that understand your Dwex application
---

## Overview

Dwex is designed from the ground up to work seamlessly with AI assistants like **Claude**, **Cursor**, and **GitHub Copilot**. By providing your AI assistant with the right context about your Dwex application, you unlock powerful capabilities for faster development, better debugging, and easier onboarding.

## How AI Helps with Dwex

### 1. Intelligent Code Generation

AI assistants understand Dwex's decorator-based architecture and can generate correct code:

```typescript
// Just tell your AI: "Create a UserService with CRUD operations"
// It generates properly structured code:

@Injectable()
export class UserService {
  constructor(private db: DatabaseService) {}

  async findAll(): Promise<User[]> {
    return this.db.users.findMany();
  }

  async create(data: CreateUserDto): Promise<User> {
    return this.db.users.create({ data });
  }
}
```

### 2. Real-Time Application Introspection

With the `@dwex/ai` module, AI can inspect your running application:

```
You: "Why is the /api/users endpoint returning 500?"
AI: *Inspects routes, services, and logs via MCP*
AI: "The UserService has a circular dependency with AuthService.
     Here's the dependency graph..."
```

### 3. Debugging and Troubleshooting

AI can analyze logs, dependencies, and routes to help you debug faster:

```
You: "The app is slow"
AI: *Checks application logs*
AI: "I see 47 slow query warnings. UserService.findAll is taking 3.2s
     average. Missing index on users.email field."
```

### 4. Team Onboarding

New developers can ask AI about your codebase:

```
Developer: "How does authentication work?"
AI: *Uses MCP to inspect routes and services*
AI: "POST /api/auth/login uses AuthService which depends on:
     - JwtService for tokens
     - UserService for user lookup
     - BcryptService for password verification"
```

## Getting Started with AI

When you create a new Dwex project, `create-dwex` can automatically set up AI assistant configuration files:

```bash
bun create dwex my-app
```

During setup, you'll be asked which AI assistants you use. Select from:
- **Claude** - Generates `CLAUDE.md` with framework context and MCP setup
- **Cursor** - Generates `.cursorrules` with Dwex best practices
- **GitHub Copilot** - Generates `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

These files teach your AI assistant about:
- Dwex architecture and patterns
- Decorator usage (`@Controller`, `@Injectable`, `@Get`, etc.)
- Dependency injection
- Module structure
- Testing conventions
- Scaffolding commands

## Real-Time Introspection

For advanced AI capabilities, enable MCP (Model Context Protocol) server in your application:

```bash
bun add @dwex/ai
```

```typescript
import { DwexFactory } from "@dwex/core";
import { AiModule } from "@dwex/ai";
import { AppModule } from "./app.module";

const app = await DwexFactory.create(AppModule);

// Enable MCP introspection
AiModule.setup(app, {
  path: "/mcp",
  enabled: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development",
});

await app.listen(3000);
```

This allows AI to:
- **List routes** and inspect handlers, guards, interceptors
- **View services** and their dependencies
- **Analyze dependency graph** to understand relationships
- **Read application logs** for debugging
- **Monitor middleware** chain

## Scaffolding Commands

Dwex provides AI-friendly commands to generate boilerplate code. Your AI assistant can use these when configured:

```bash
# Generate a new module
dwex generate module users

# Generate a controller
dwex generate controller users

# Generate a service
dwex generate service users

# Generate a complete resource (module + controller + service)
dwex generate resource products
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Code Generation

```
You: "Create a ProductsModule with CRUD operations"
AI: *Generates module, controller, service with proper decorators*
```

### 2. Debugging

```
You: "Why is /api/orders returning 404?"
AI: *Checks routes via MCP*
AI: "OrderController is registered but the route is /order (singular).
     Did you mean to use /orders?"
```

### 3. Architecture Questions

```
You: "How should I organize authentication?"
AI: *Reads CLAUDE.md or .cursorrules*
AI: "Create an AuthModule with:
     - AuthService for business logic
     - AuthGuard for route protection
     - JwtStrategy for token validation"
```

### 4. Refactoring

```
You: "Can I safely rename UserService to AccountService?"
AI: *Uses dependency graph via MCP*
AI: "UserService is used by:
     - AuthService
     - ProfileController
     - OrderService
     I'll update all 3 references..."
```

## Benefits

1. **Faster Onboarding** - New developers get instant answers about architecture
2. **Consistent Code** - AI generates code following Dwex patterns
3. **Better Debugging** - Real-time introspection finds issues quickly
4. **Reduced Context Switching** - Ask AI instead of searching docs
5. **Refactoring Confidence** - AI analyzes dependencies before changes
