title: AI-First Framework
description: Dwex is the first web framework designed from the ground up for AI-powered development
---

## Overview

Dwex is the **world's first AI-first web framework**. Unlike traditional frameworks that were retrofitted for AI assistance, Dwex was designed from day one to work seamlessly with AI coding agents like Claude, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot.

## What Makes Dwex AI-First?

### 1. Built-In AI Context

Every Dwex project comes with pre-configured AI assistant instructions:

- **CLAUDE.md** - Framework guidelines and patterns for Claude Code
- **.cursorrules** - Cursor AI rules and best practices
- **.github/copilot-instructions.md** - GitHub Copilot context

These files teach AI assistants about Dwex's architecture, conventions, and patterns—enabling them to generate correct, idiomatic code without you having to explain the framework every time.

### 2. Real-Time Application Introspection

The `@dwex/ai` module provides **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** server capabilities, allowing AI assistants to:

- Inspect your application's routes, services, and dependencies in real-time
- Debug issues by analyzing logs and dependency graphs
- Answer questions about your codebase structure
- Monitor application health and performance

Think of it as giving your AI assistant "x-ray vision" into your running application.

### 3. Declarative, Pattern-Based Architecture

Dwex's decorator-based architecture is **inherently AI-friendly**:

```typescript
@Controller("/users")
export class UserController {
  constructor(private userService: UserService) {}

  @Get()
  async findAll() {
    return this.userService.findAll();
  }

  @Post()
  @UseGuards(AuthGuard)
  async create(@Body() data: CreateUserDto) {
    return this.userService.create(data);
  }
}
```

AI assistants can easily understand and generate this declarative code because:
- Patterns are explicit and consistent
- Dependencies are clearly declared
- Metadata is self-documenting
- Structure follows conventions

### 4. Intelligent Scaffolding

Dwex's CLI provides AI-friendly scaffolding commands that AI assistants can use automatically:

```bash
# AI can run these commands to generate boilerplate
dwex generate module users
dwex generate controller products
dwex generate resource orders
```

AI assistants can leverage these commands to generate entire features with proper structure, saving you from writing repetitive code.

## How AI Transforms Dwex Development

### From Idea to Production Faster

With AI assistance, building a Dwex application becomes a conversation:

```
You: "Create an authentication system with JWT tokens"

AI: *Uses scaffolding to generate AuthModule*
    *Creates AuthService with login/register methods*
    *Implements AuthGuard for route protection*
    *Adds JWT middleware and token validation*
    *Generates proper DTOs and error handling*

Result: Production-ready auth system in seconds
```

### Debugging at AI Speed

AI can diagnose issues instantly using MCP introspection:

```
You: "The /api/orders endpoint is returning 500"

AI: *Inspects route via MCP*
    *Checks OrderService dependencies*
    *Analyzes recent error logs*
    *Identifies circular dependency*

Result: Root cause found in seconds, not hours
```

### Refactoring with Confidence

AI understands your entire application structure:

```
You: "Refactor PaymentService to use Stripe instead of PayPal"

AI: *Uses dependency graph via MCP*
    *Identifies all services using PaymentService*
    *Updates implementations across 5 files*
    *Generates new DTOs and interfaces*
    *Updates tests and documentation*

Result: Safe, comprehensive refactoring
```

### Zero-Friction Onboarding

New developers can ask AI about your codebase:

```
Developer: "How does authentication work in this app?"

AI: *Inspects AuthModule via MCP*
    *Shows dependency tree*
    *Explains guard implementation*
    *Provides code examples*

Result: Instant understanding without reading docs
```

## The AI-First Development Workflow

1. **Start with Intent** - Tell your AI what you want to build
2. **AI Generates Code** - Using Dwex patterns from CLAUDE.md/.cursorrules
3. **AI Self-Validates** - Uses MCP to inspect what was created
4. **Iterative Refinement** - AI debugs and improves using real-time introspection
5. **Ship to Production** - With confidence from AI-verified architecture

## Why This Matters

Traditional frameworks require developers to:
- Manually explain architecture to AI assistants
- Copy-paste documentation into prompts
- Debug AI-generated code that doesn't follow framework patterns
- Spend time teaching AI instead of building features

Dwex eliminates this friction by:
- **Pre-configuring** AI assistants with framework knowledge
- **Providing introspection** so AI can verify its own work
- **Enforcing patterns** that AI can reliably understand and generate
- **Enabling AI autonomy** through scaffolding and MCP tools

## Real-World Benefits

### 10x Faster Feature Development

AI generates entire modules with proper structure, error handling, validation, and tests—in seconds.

### Instant Debugging

AI can inspect your running application, analyze logs, and trace dependencies without you manually searching files.

### Consistent Code Quality

AI-generated code follows Dwex patterns automatically, ensuring consistency across your entire team.

### Reduced Cognitive Load

Offload boilerplate generation, debugging, and refactoring to AI while you focus on business logic.

### Better Collaboration

New team members can ask AI about the codebase instead of interrupting senior developers.

## Getting Started

When you create a new Dwex project:

```bash
bun create dwex my-app
```

You'll be asked which AI assistants you use. Select your preferences and Dwex will generate the appropriate configuration files automatically.

From there, your AI assistant is ready to:
- Generate controllers, services, and modules
- Debug issues using application introspection
- Answer questions about your codebase
- Refactor code safely with dependency awareness
