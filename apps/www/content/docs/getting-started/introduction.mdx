description: A progressive TypeScript framework for building efficient server-side applications on Bun runtime

## What is Dwex?

Dwex is a lightweight, TypeScript-first web framework designed specifically for the Bun runtime. It brings the power of decorator-based routing and dependency injection to create maintainable, scalable server-side applications with exceptional performance.

## Philosophy

Dwex is built on the principle that building server-side applications should be **enjoyable**, **productive**, and **maintainable**. Inspired by modern frameworks like NestJS and Express, Dwex leverages TypeScript decorators and dependency injection to create clean, modular architecture.

### Key Principles

- **TypeScript-First**: Built from the ground up with TypeScript for excellent type safety and developer experience
- **Bun-Native**: Harnesses the full power of Bun's performance and modern JavaScript features
- **Modular Architecture**: Organize code into reusable, maintainable modules
- **Decorator-Driven**: Intuitive decorator-based API for routes, dependencies, and middleware
- **Dependency Injection**: Built-in DI container for managing dependencies and promoting testable code

## Core Features

### Decorator-Based Routing

Define routes using intuitive decorators:

```typescript
@Controller("users")
export class UserController {
	@Get(":id")
	findOne(@Param("id") id: string) {
		return { id, name: "John Doe" };
	}

	@Post()
	create(@Body() data: CreateUserDto) {
		return { success: true, data };
	}
}
```

### Powerful Dependency Injection

Automatic dependency resolution with scoped instances:

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class UserService {
	constructor(private db: DatabaseService) {}

	async findUser(id: string) {
		return this.db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", [id]);
	}
}
```

### Modular Architecture

Organize features into cohesive modules:

```typescript
@Module({
	imports: [DatabaseModule, LoggerModule],
	controllers: [UserController],
	providers: [UserService],
	exports: [UserService],
})
export class UserModule {}
```

### Guards & Interceptors

Protect routes and transform responses:

```typescript
@Controller("admin")
@UseGuards(AuthGuard, AdminGuard)
export class AdminController {
	@Get("dashboard")
	@UseInterceptors(LoggingInterceptor)
	getDashboard() {
		return { stats: "..." };
	}
}
```

## Why Dwex?

### Lightning Fast

Built for Bun, Dwex delivers exceptional performance with minimal overhead. Bun's native speed combined with Dwex's efficient architecture means your APIs respond faster.

### Type-Safe

Full TypeScript support means fewer runtime errors and better IDE support. Catch bugs at compile time, not in production.

### Developer-Friendly

Familiar patterns for developers coming from NestJS, while being simpler and more lightweight. The decorator-based API is intuitive and reduces boilerplate.

### Production-Ready

Includes essential features out of the box: authentication, logging, exception handling, CORS, and more.
