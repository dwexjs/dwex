## Available Scopes

- **Singleton** (default) - One instance per application
- **Request** - New instance per request
- **Transient** - New instance every time it's injected

## Example

```typescript
@Injectable({ scope: Scope.REQUEST })
export class RequestScopedService {
	// New instance for each HTTP request
}
```
